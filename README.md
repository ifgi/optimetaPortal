# OPTIMETA Portal - OPTIMAP

[![Project Status: Moved to [http://example.com](https://github.com/GeoinformationSystems/optimap/) ‚Äì The project has been moved to a new location, and the version at that location should be considered authoritative.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/moved.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#moved) to [[http://example.com](https://github.com/GeoinformationSystems/optimap/)]([http://example.com](https://github.com/GeoinformationSystems/optimap/)) [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.8198944.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8198944)

Geospatial discovery of research articles based on open metadata.
The OPTIMETA Portal is part of the OPTIMETA project (<https://projects.tib.eu/optimeta>) and relies on the spatial and temporal metadata collected for scientific papers with the OPTIMETA Geo Plugin for Open Journal Systems ([OJS](https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/)) published at <https://github.com/TIBHannover/optimetaGeo>.
The product name of the portal is OPTIMAP.

The OPTIMAP has the following features:

- Start page with a full screen map (showing geometries and metadata) and a time line of the areas and time periods of interest for scientific publications
- Passwordless login via email
- RESTful API at `/api`

OPTIMAP is based on [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) (with [GeoDjango](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/contrib/gis/) and [Django REST framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/)) with a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)/[PostGIS](https://postgis.net/) database backend.

## Configuration

All configuration is done via the file `optimetaPortal/settings.py`.
Configurations that need to be changed for different installations and for deployment are also exposed as environment variables.
The names of these environment variables start with `OPTIMAP_`.
The settings files loads these from a file `.env` stored in the same location as `settings.py`, or from the environment the server is run it.
A complete list of existing parameters is provided in the file `optimetaPortal/.env.example`.

## Run with Docker

```bash
docker-compose up

# run migrations, in the directory where docker-compose is to resolve the name "web"
docker-compose run web python manage.py makemigrations
docker-compose run web python manage.py migrate
```

Now open a browser at <http://localhost:8000/>.

## Development

### Test data

The folder `/fixtures` contains some test data, either as an SQL command to insert into the database, or as a database dump that was created and can be loaded with [`django-admin`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/django-admin/).
[`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) is used for pretty-printing of the output.

```bash
# create dump after creating/harvesting test data:
python manage.py dumpdata --exclude=auth --exclude=contenttypes | jq > fixtures/test_data.json

# load:
python manage.py loaddata fixtures/test_data.json
```

### Run locally

Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` in the same directory where `settings.py` resides and fill in the configuration settings as needed.

```bash
# once onle: create virtual environment
# mkvirtualenv optimetaPortal
workon optimetaPortal

pip install -r requirements.txt

# create and start local DB (once)
docker run --name optimetaPortalDB -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_USER=optimeta -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=optimeta -e POSTGRES_DB=optimetaPortal -d postgis/postgis:14-3.3
# stop and restart it with
# docker stop optimetaPortalDB
# docker start optimetaPortalDB

# run migrations
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

# create cache table
python manage.py createcachetable

# collect static files
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput

# start app
python manage.py runserver

# start app with configuration for development
OPTIMAP_CACHE=dummy OPTIMAP_DEBUG=True python manage.py runserver
```

Now open a browser at <http://127.0.0.1:8000/>.

### Debug with VS Code

Select the Python interpreter created above (`optimetaPortal` environment), see instructions at <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/tutorial-django>.

Configuration for debugging with VS Code:

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Python: Django Run",
            "type": "python",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/manage.py",
            "args": [
                "runserver"
            ],
            "env": {
                "OPTIMAP_DEBUG": "True",
                "OPTIMAP_CACHE": "dummy"
            },
            "django": true,
            "justMyCode": true
        }
    ]
}
```

### Debug email sending

Add `EMAIL_BACKEND=django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend` to the `.env` file to have emails printed to the console instead of sent via SMTP.

Alternatively, you can run a local STMP server with the following command and configuration:

```bash
python -m smtpd -c DebuggingServer -n localhost:5587
```

```env
OPTIMAP_EMAIL_HOST=localhost
OPTIMAP_EMAIL_PORT=5587
```

### Create superusers/admin

Superusers/admin can be created  using the createsuperuser command:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser --username=joe --email=joe@example.com
```

You will be prompted for a password.
After you enter one, the user will be created immediately. If you leave off the --username or --email options, it will prompt you for those values.

You can acess the admin page at <http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/>.

You can also run the command in a containerised app with `docker-compose run web python manage.py ...`.

### Run tests

See <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/testing/overview/> for testing Django apps.

UI tests are based on [Helium](https://github.com/mherrmann/selenium-python-helium) (because [Pylenium](https://github.com/ElSnoMan/pyleniumio) would need pytest in addition).

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

```bash
python manage.py test tests

# show deprecation warnings
python -Wa manage.py test

# running UI tests needs either compose configuration or a manage.py runserver in a seperate shell
docker-compose up --build

python -Wa manage.py test tests-ui
```

### Develop tests

For developing the UI tests, you can remove the `headless=True` in the statements for starting the browsers so you can "watch along" and inspect the HTML when a breakpoint is hit as the tests are executed.

### Debug tests with VS Code

A configuration to debug the test code and also print deprecation warnings:

```json
{
    "name": "Python: Django Test",
    "type": "python",
    "request": "launch",
    "pythonArgs": [
        "-Wa"
    ],
    "program": "${workspaceFolder}/manage.py",
    "args": [
        "test",
        "tests"
    ],
    "env": {
        "OPTIMAP_DEBUG": "True"
    },
    "django": true,
    "justMyCode": true
}
```

Change the argument `tests` to `tests-ui` to run the UI tests.
